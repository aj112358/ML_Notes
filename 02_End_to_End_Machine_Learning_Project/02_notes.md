## 2.0 - Steps in a ML Project

Here are the main steps in any ML project:

1. Look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for ML algorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your ML system

there are lots of ways to get data ....
