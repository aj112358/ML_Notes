# Ch 2 - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Chapter Objectives

1. Learn the main steps of a ML project
2. Illustrate these steps on a ML project
3. Learn the details of each step
4. Write sample code for each step


## 2.0 - Steps in a ML Project

Here are the main steps in any ML project:

1. Look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for ML algorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your ML system

To illustrate these steps, we will go through an entire ML project from start to finish using a real data set, one that is very commonly used as an example for any beginning ML student, called the "California Housing Prices dataset". This is a data set that contains data on prices of houses in California back in 1990 which was collected through a census survey. This data set can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices

_NOTE: For the purposes of this course, we will use a modified version of this data set (see later...)

There any many different sources where one can procure data sets from. Here are some online sources:

* Open data repositories
  * UC Irvine ML Repository
  * Kaggle
  * Amazon's AWS data sets
* Meta portals (list of data repositories)
  * Data Portals
  * OpenDataMonitor
  * Quandl
* Other websites
  * Wikipedia's list of ML data sets
  * Quora
  * Datasets subreddit
  
Of course, it is also possible to collect your own data! Here are some ways you could do so:

* Sensor data
  * Arduino Uno microcontroller
    * Has sensors for temperature, humidity, water level, sound, etc.)
    * Will have to make your own circuit
* Web scraping
  * Write Python code to scrape a website
    * Libraries to use: BeautifulSoup, Requests, lxml, Selenium
* In-Perosn data collection
  * Create your own surveys (with qualitative and quantitative questions)
  * Hold focus groups
