# ML_Notes
This repository is meant to be a medium for learning ML using the well known O'Reilly book "Hands-On Machine Learning...".



### History of Machine Learning

* late 1990s - Worldwide research of deep NN training is abandoned 
* 2006 - Geoffrey Hinton et at. publish a paper titled *"A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets"*, showing how a deep NN can be trained to do handwriten digit recognition with 98% accuracy (they called it "deep learning")
* 2019 - The second edition of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow" is published!

### Tools Used In ML

* Scikit-Learn

This is a Python framework for performing ML computations.

* TensorFlow

Similar to Scikit-Learn, this is a library that allows one to create more complex ML models, as well as train deep NNs, and also allows for distributed computing

* Keras

This is a high-level DL API that TensorFlow has adopted as it's main API. It allows users a simple way to code NNs.

* Python

This is a high-level programming language that is commonly used for coding ML/DL algorithms.

* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

These are a few libraries available for use in Python, that allow you to perform mathematical/scientific computations and create visualizations. Other libraries that also fall into these categories are: SciPy, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.

* Mathematics

To truly learn ML/DL at the foundational level, you will need a good background in calculus, linear algebra, statistics and probability.

* Jupyter Notebooks

This is an application that allows you to write code and execute it line-by-line. You can also write regular text, add visuals, and write LaTeX equations.
